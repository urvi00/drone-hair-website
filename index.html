            <p class="title-3">Our Vision</p>
            <p>
                DroneHair was founded in 2020 Italy during the coronavirus pandemic, by an Italian vampire named Sergio Sasso. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sasso was tired of having to go without a stylist for months due to the imposed lockdown and social distancing. The pandemic was 
                particularly hard on the vampires of Italy, because even though they were immune to the deadly virus, they could not cut their own hair 
                (vampires do not show up in mirrors). Many vampires were driven to madness by the mere thought of not being able to maintain their pristine 
                appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to save the vampire population of Italy from extinction, Sasso came up with the idea of drones that would go to peopleâ€™s 
                homes and provide a personalized, safe, and hygienic hair styling experience. Soon the service became popular not only among vampires, 
                but also the non-vampiric people of Italy.
